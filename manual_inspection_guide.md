# Manual Inspection Guide for Generated Video Frames using a Video Editor (DaVinci Resolve)

This guide provides a step-by-step process for manually inspecting video frames generated by AI or any other process using DaVinci Resolve. This method allows for detailed examination of each frame to ensure accuracy, content correctness, and proper functioning of dynamic elements.

## 1. Loading the Generated Video into the Editor

**Step 1: Open DaVinci Resolve.** Launch the DaVinci Resolve application on your computer.

**Step 2: Create or Open a Project.**
   *   If you're starting a new inspection, create a new project. Select a project name, frame rate, and resolution that matches your generated video.
   *   If you're working within an existing project, open that project.

**Step 3: Import the Video File.** There are several ways to import your generated video:

   *   **Method 1: Drag and Drop:**  Navigate to the "Media" page (bottom left). Drag the video file from your file explorer (e.g., Windows Explorer, Finder) directly into the "Media Pool" area of the "Media" page.
   *   **Method 2: Import from the File Menu:**  Go to `File > Import > Media`.  Browse to the location of your video file and select it.
   *   **Method 3: Drag and Drop to Timeline:** Navigate to the "Edit" page (bottom center). Drag the video file directly from the Media Pool onto the timeline.

**Visual Aid (Screenshot - Optional):**

*(Ideally, include a screenshot here showing the Media Pool with a video file imported and a video file placed on the timeline in the Edit page.)*

## 2. Navigating Through Individual Frames

**Step 1: Navigate to the "Edit" Page.**  Select the "Edit" page at the bottom of the DaVinci Resolve interface (usually indicated by an icon resembling a clapperboard).

**Step 2: Use the Frame Navigation Tools.**  The "Edit" page provides tools for precise frame-by-frame navigation:

   *   **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Pressing the left arrow key steps *backward* one frame. Pressing the right arrow key steps *forward* one frame.  This is the most precise method.
   *   **Comma (,) and Period (.) Keys:**  Pressing the comma (`,`) key steps backward one frame (same as left arrow).  Pressing the period (`.`) key steps forward one frame (same as right arrow).  A little less intuitive.
   *   **J, K, L Keys (Playhead Control):** These keys can be used to scrub through the timeline. *J* rewinds, *K* pauses, and *L* fast forwards.  Repeatedly pressing `L` increases speed.  *K* stops playback.

**Step 3: Focus on the Viewer Window.** The viewer window (upper right, generally) will display the current frame. Use the navigation methods to move to the desired frame for inspection.

**Visual Aid (Screenshot - Optional):**

*(Ideally, include a screenshot showing the Edit page, a video on the timeline, and the viewer window, highlighting the frame navigation keys or controls.)*

## 3. Verifying the Grid Layout

**Step 1: Identify the Expected Grid.** Before inspecting, have a clear understanding of the intended grid layout of your generated video. This might involve dividing the frame into sections, regions, or cells.  Document this layout.  For example:

   *   "Top third: Text overlay. Bottom third: Image. Center: Video element."
   *   "Four quadrants: Quadrant 1: Text, Quadrant 2: Image, Quadrant 3: Video, Quadrant 4: Another Text."

**Step 2: Visually Inspect Each Frame.**  Use the frame navigation tools (described in Section 2) to move through each frame.  Carefully examine the layout of the frame.  Ask yourself these questions for each frame:

   *   **Are elements placed where they should be?**  Does the text appear in the intended location? Is the image positioned correctly within its designated area?
   *   **Are proportions correct?**  Do elements occupy the intended amount of space? Does a video element fill the space that it needs to?
   *   **Are there any unexpected visual anomalies?** Are objects overlapping incorrectly, are there any glitches or artifacts?

**Step 3: Zoom (Optional, but often useful).** If you need a closer look, you can zoom in on the frame using the zoom controls in the viewer window (often a slider or buttons).  This is especially helpful for checking small details or precise positioning.

**Visual Aid (Screenshot - Optional):**

*(Ideally, include a screenshot of a frame being inspected, with annotations highlighting the key layout elements and highlighting areas of focus.)*

## 4. Checking the Accuracy of Content Rendering

**Step 1: Define the Content to Verify.** Determine what specific content you need to verify within each frame. This might include:

   *   **Text:**  Accuracy of text content, font, size, color.
   *   **Images:** Correct image displayed, no distortion or errors.
   *   **Video Elements:**  Correct video clips or frames displayed, any special effects rendering correctly.
   *   **Colors and Gradients:** If your generation incorporates certain colors, ensure they display correctly.

**Step 2: Scrutinize Each Element.**  For each frame, carefully examine the content according to the definitions in Step 1.

   *   **Text:** Read the text to verify its accuracy. Check the font, size, and color against the expected design.
   *   **Images:** Verify that the correct image is displayed and that it isn't distorted or corrupted. Check for correct cropping or scaling.
   *   **Video Elements:** Ensure the correct video clip or frame is present. Ensure any special effects (e.g., transitions, filters) are rendered properly.
   *   **Colors and Gradients:** Examine colors, ensure they are not off or not what was expected.

**Step 3: Document Any Errors.** If you identify any errors, make notes about the frame number and the specific issue.

**Visual Aid (Screenshot - Optional):**

*(Ideally, include a screenshot highlighting a specific area of the frame containing text or an image, with annotations pointing out any rendering issues, such as incorrect text, blurry image, or color discrepancies.)*

## 5. Confirming that Dynamic Updates are Functioning as Expected

**Step 1: Understand the Dynamic Elements.**  Identify the elements that are expected to change over time (e.g., text that updates, images that change, video elements that move or transition).  What should they change?  What is the planned timing?

**Step 2: Inspect Through the Timeline.** Use frame-by-frame navigation to move through the timeline, paying close attention to the dynamic elements.  Ensure they are behaving as intended.

   *   **Text Updates:**  Does the text update at the correct time? Is the new text displayed accurately?
   *   **Image Changes:**  Does the image change at the appropriate time? Is the new image displayed correctly?
   *   **Element Transitions:**  Are transitions (e.g., fades, wipes) working as expected? Are the timings of the transitions correct?
   *   **Motion:** Does elements move as anticipated?

**Step 3: Note Timing Discrepancies.**  If you find the timing is incorrect, note the frame numbers where the discrepancies occur.  If something is supposed to happen at a specific time, confirm that it occurs at that time.

**Step 4: Verify smooth behavior** Check for any jerks, stutters, or other visual irregularities when elements are changing.

**Visual Aid (Screenshot - Optional):**

*(Ideally, include a series of screenshots showing a dynamic element (e.g., text that changes or an image that transitions) over several frames, along with annotations highlighting the changing content and its timing.)*
